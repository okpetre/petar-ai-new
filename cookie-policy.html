        <h1>Cookie Policy for Petar.AI</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated: July 16, 2025</strong></p>

        <p>This Cookie Policy explains how Petar.AI ("we," "us," or "our") uses cookies and similar technologies when you visit our website, petar.ai (the "Website"). It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.</p>

        <h2>1. What Are Cookies?</h2>
        <p>Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.</p>
        <p>Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Petar.AI) are called "first-party cookies." Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third-party cookies." Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.</p>

        <h2>2. Why Do We Use Cookies?</h2>
        <p>We use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for our Website to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Website. Third parties serve cookies through our Website for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.</p>
        <p>The specific types of first and third-party cookies served through our Website and the purposes they perform are described below:</p>

        <h3>2.1. Essential Cookies</h3>
        <p>These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our Website and to use some of its features, such as accessing secure areas. Without these cookies, services like user login, shopping carts, and secure payment processing cannot be provided.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Enable core Website functionality, security, and accessibility.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Collected:</strong> Session IDs, security tokens.</li>
            <li><strong>Managed By:</strong> First-party.</li>
            <li><strong>User Control:</strong> Cannot be disabled as they are essential for Website operation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.2. Analytics and Performance Cookies</h3>
        <p>These cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our Website is being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our Website for you.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To analyze Website traffic, track user behavior (e.g., pages visited, time spent on site), identify popular content, and improve Website performance and user experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Google Analytics cookies.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Collected:</strong> IP address (anonymized), device information, browser type, pages visited, time on site.</li>
            <li><strong>Managed By:</strong> First-party and Third-party (e.g., Google).</li>
            <li><strong>User Control:</strong> You can usually opt out of these cookies via our cookie consent banner or your browser settings.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.3. Functionality Cookies</h3>
        <p>These cookies allow our Website to remember choices you make (such as your username, language, or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personal features. For example, they can be used to remember changes you have made to text size, fonts, and other parts of web pages that you can customize.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Enhance user experience by remembering preferences and settings.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Collected:</strong> User preferences (e.g., language selection).</li>
            <li><strong>Managed By:</strong> First-party.</li>
            <li><strong>User Control:</strong> You can usually disable these via your browser settings, but it may affect your personalized experience.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.4. Advertising and Targeting Cookies</h3>
        <p>These cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you and your interests. They perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed for advertisers, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Deliver targeted advertising, measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns.</li>
            <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Cookies from advertising networks (e.g., Google Ads, social media platforms if integrated).</li>
            <li><strong>Data Collected:</strong> Browse habits, interests, demographics (often inferred).</li>
            <li><strong>Managed By:</strong> Third-party.</li>
            <li><strong>User Control:</strong> You can typically opt out of these cookies via our cookie consent banner, your browser settings, or specific opt-out mechanisms provided by the third parties.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How You Can Control Cookies</h2>
        <p>You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can exercise your cookie preferences by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cookie Consent Banner:</strong> Upon your first visit to our Website, you will see a cookie consent banner that allows you to accept all cookies, customize your preferences, or reject non-essential cookies. You can usually revisit your cookie preferences at any time by clicking on a "Cookie Settings" or "Cookie Preferences" link (often in the footer of the Website).</li>
            <li><strong>Browser Controls:</strong> Most web browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings preferences. You can set your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, if you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of our Service.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Other Tracking Technologies</h2>
        <p>We may use other similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs"). These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited our Website or opened an email that we have sent them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Website to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Website from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, and to improve site performance.</p>

        <h2>5. Changes to Our Cookie Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time to reflect changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Please revisit this Cookie Policy regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies. The "Last Updated" date at the top of this Cookie Policy indicates when it was last revised.</p>

        <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
